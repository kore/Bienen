Bienen
======

Playground project implementing ideas about teaching kids programming.

The foxus is to omit syntax for now and allow them to "program" a bee using a
graphical interface. The interface controls the bees movements. It is similar
to other approaches, but is supposed to be run justin the browser.

Requirements
============

Just a web browser.

"Programming" Ideas
===================

* Define a series of commands to reach a goal

  * Obstacles in the level

* Define "functions" (groups of commands)

  * Iterface unclear

* Define loops (iterate command group)

  * Interface unclear

* Variable(s)?

  * Not usre how / where to use and interface unclear

Application Ideas
=================

* Define more levels

* Store progress in locally

* Improve interfaces (guide kids through the process)

..
   Local Variables:
   mode: rst
   fill-column: 79
   End: 
   vim: et syn=rst tw=79
